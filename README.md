# Activatory

This is my first Dart project.
It's aimed to add test data generator to Dart's ecosystem and to simplify/speedup tests writing.

This project is inspired by .NET Autofixture library (because I'm used to using it in my previous work).

Also, this is my pet project so there are no exact plans and etc.

## TODO's:
- [x] Add primitive types support
- [ ] Add complex types support
  - [x] first ctor
  - [ ] factory methods
  - [ ] named constructors
  - [ ] put all together and find minimal/random way of creation
- [ ] Add implicit factory registration
- [ ] Add fixed (singleton) values support
- [ ] Add parameter overloading by name
- [ ] Add parameter overloadyng by type
  - [ ] exact match
  - [ ] any subtypes match
- [ ] Add configuration layers and reusability for complex cases
- [ ] Add paramsObject and paramsObject to factory matching
- [ ] Add ability to customize context before data generation without saving settings to context
- [ ] Add paramsObject layering
- [ ] *Read autofixture sources to gather ideas and vision
- [ ] *Add examples and docs
- [ ] *Add CI/CD:
  - [ ] *build and publish to pub
  - [ ] *coverage reports
- [ ] Add nice looking readme and github repo info
- [ ] Add recursion handling (which one strategy should be used?)
